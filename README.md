# The_new_era-of_computers
 This project is based on the computer vision. Gestures captured with a built-in camera or webcam and processed with color segmentation &amp; detection technique. The user will be allowed to control some of the computer cursor functions with their hands which bear colored caps on fingertips. Primarily, a user can perform left clicks, right clicks, and double clicks, scrolling up or down using their hand in different gestures. This system captures frames using a webcam or built-in cam and processes the frames to make them track-able and after that recognizes different gestures made by users and perform the mouse function. So the proposed mouse system eliminates device dependency in order to use a mouse.
